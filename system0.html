            <h3>Remains Located</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Wednesday, June 14th of 2006. <br><br>
                More remains of the unidentified object have been found in the wilderness of ohio. 
                The remains are more preserved than the last ones. There seems to be a pink substance
                covering some of the material and eggs of unknown origin were found in good condition
                for studies. We are yet to uncover what the artifacts found are, but most seem to be
                man-made objects that were somehow altered by whatever is responsible for the rest of
                the ship. <br>
                Some symbols have been noticed on some artifacts and other remains of the unidentified
                object. Our linguist Margaret Armstrong is leading an intense research under those symbols,
                to try and understand what they could mean. Evidence leads to the belief that those symbols
                seem to work like some sort of ideogram, but further information on them is kept with
                Margaret. <br>
                The eggs are being researched by our biologist Gregory Nunez, in an isolated area of the
                base to prevent any breaches.

            <h3>Ideograms and Music</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Tuesday, June 20th of 2006. <br><br>
                The ideograms seem to follow a linear pattern, with each line being a phrase and each
                word relating to the word after it. I have managed to gather some more <span class="glitched">information and content regarding the language</span>
                in the cybernetic research done by mister David, one of
                our very experient technical experts. I did my best to translate each word in a coherent
                and comprehensive manner, so that the rest of the team can use it to ease their research. <br>
                One interesting thing that I have noticed is that each word can easily be transcribed as
                <span class="glitched">musical notes</span>, disregarding their octaves. The evidence that led to this discovery is a
                song that has been discovered by, once again, the cybernetic research made on some components
                of the unidentified object. The translation to the song and more words have been attached below,
                on a document I have written. <br><br>
